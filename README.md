Basic Object Orientated Software Engineering (BOOSE).  

## Todor Vasilev
## Group 4
Each element is covered in the weekly sessions, using the BOOSE library source code as an example.  
I will discuss how I implemented the more difficult elements (like the parser, implementing loops etc.)  
Keep your progress up to date below. Put "DONE" after each section, when you have done it.  
The number in brackets represents the component that each element contributes to.
